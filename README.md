# Make-Your-Voice-Heard-UR
- **History repeats itself because people tend to forget**
- I want this website to be a platform where one can share their thoughts freely, and also keep an archive of all the incidents that happened(in the past and ongoing) on this campus.
- We DO NOT want to use this against our school or any individual. Our intention is to keep a clear-structured archive to help our students and school to better reflect on past cases, and to help those that faces discrimination.


# What to do when you encounter discrimination in any form 
- Report! Report! Report!
- You can reach out to any faculty in this campus! 
- Talk to your friends, we will walk alone when facing racism!

# Why you should report the incident 

For youself
--- 
Reporting incidents is to protect **YOUR OWN SAFETY**.
When you report an incident, you do not have to interact with those who had verbally or physically abused you. This will protect you from any further potential retaliation.

For the whole community
---
Reporting a incident is not only for yourself, but also for the good of our whole community. If one racist gets away without punishments, it will set a bad example for many.
So we strongly encourage you to stand up and speak out, your brave action will contribute to our diversity, and help end racism which affects every single one of us.

It violates laws, university policies and values

# What to avoid after you encounter discrimation/assault
- It is advised to avoid contact with the person or group of people who initiated the act of discrimination or assault unless absolutely necessary. 
- If you find yourself in a situation where the person who initiated the act of discrimination, it is important to have a University official and/or someone you trust present. This way there is at least one witness present in case information needs to be confirmed later on. 
- You don't owe your offender any of your time to hear out their explanations. It is possible they will try to make you feel guilty for your involvement in the situation or coerce you to do something you don't want to do.
